# The adventure of the Damned Willow Forest!

* This is a text adventure game based off of my own imagination. Worth mentioning is the fact that it has some inspiration taken from The lord of the rings. The player is presented with the context of them standing outside of a forest, and they have to go through it if they want to go back home. The sign at the edge of the forest explains that they will encounter som obstacles and mystical creatures on their way. Well inside the player will meet everythig between a goblin to a witch, each of these characters will offer something valuable. At the end the player will meet a Wizard, he wants to know if the player has seen his treasure, and if so the Wizard will help the player to get to the end of the forest so that he can go home, if not the player has to get over the wild stream by themself.

* The player also has an inventory where they can carry the treasures and valuables.

## Flowchart

* I have created a flowchart to help myself plan out the bascis of the game. This helped me a lot when I started to plan out which path was connected to which and so on. When looking at the chart one can understand the basic knowledge of what to do.

* The original one I made was not the one that resulted in the finished product, I realised that some of the steps that I first planned out was a bit unnecessary.

* This is the one I ended up using:
